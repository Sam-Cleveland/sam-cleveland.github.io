                    Hey, My name is Sam Cleveland. I am a Junior at DCA in El Dorado
                    Hills, California. I enjoy programming, reading, playing the piano,
                    learning math, and playing chess among many other things. This
                    website is a place where I can show off all the stuff I do. I have
                    worked on many projects and have many planned so make sure to
                    check out all the different things I do.<br>
                    <br>
                    I have enjoyed coding and writing programs since I was young. The
                    programming languages that I use most frequently are Java, Python,
                    HTML5, javascript(node.js), and C++. I like making all different
                    types of things, but Machine Learning is particularly interesting
                    to me.
                    <br>
                    I go to District Church and am a firm beleiver in Jesus Christ. I
                    enjoy participating in worship (whether in the band or not), and
                    I love connecting with other beleivers to talk about faith. I am
                    always trying to read the Bible more and spend more time with God.
                    My favorite Bible verse is Proverbs 3:5-6, "Trust in the LORD with
                    all your heart and lean not on your own understanding. In all your
                    ways submit to him and he will make your paths straight."<br>
                    <br>
                    I play keys (piano) in the worship band at District church on
                    Sundays and I enjoy listening to and playing music. I am always
                    trying to get better and learn more to sound better for myself and
                    for anyone that I play for. I might release music in the future if
                    I ever get around to learning the ins and outs of creating it. So
                    look out for that.<br>
                    <br>
                    Other than that, I enjoy reading, school(sometimes), playing chess
                    solving rubik's cubes, swimming, hiking, languages and other stuff
                    too. My favorite book is the screwtape letters but some other good
                    ones that I reccomend are The Road, Humble Pi, The Martian,
                    Hail Mary, The C.S. Lewis Space Trilogy, Ender's Game, and The
                    Three Body Problem. I play chess a lot but I still have a lot to
                    learn. Languages and Linguistics have always interested me and I
                    am studying Spanish currently but I would like to learn several
                    languages.<br>
